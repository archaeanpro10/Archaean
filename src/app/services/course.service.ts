         <h2>Key Learning Objectives:</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>
                 <strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> Students will begin their journey into web designing by
                 delving deep into HTML, the backbone of the web. They will master HTML's structure and semantics, learn to
                 create structured documents, incorporate multimedia elements, and understand how to develop accessible and
                 well-organized web content.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Building on HTML, this course will explore the art of web design
                 through CSS. Students will discover how to control layout, format text, and apply visual styles to their web
                 pages. By understanding CSS principles, students will develop the ability to craft aesthetically pleasing and
